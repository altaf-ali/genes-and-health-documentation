Sometimes it is necessary to get data or code into the TRE. As the
TRE is shut off from the internet this present a challenge. This guide
explains how to do this.

## Copying text in
A small amount of text can be pasted in from external systems using the Clipboard tool. This does not allow copy/paste out. This might be useful 
should you need to copy in a difficult to write function for example. 

## Getting user data into the TRE
Only admins can upload (larger amounts of) data into the TRE. Please put in a helpdesk request if you require new data or software upload. Please email [hgi@sanger.ac.uk](mailto:hgi@sanger.ac.uk) to set up a ticket.

> Please be aware at present, all users in your sandbox can see all data
that is being stored in the `red` library. For this reason, it is important that you do not upload any data that you do not want other users to see for example,  individual level data.
