## Why a Trusted Research Environment (TRE)?
Many large genetics and health data studies such as Finngen, UK Biobank, Genomics England, NIHGRI are using Trusted Research Environments. Health Data Research UK is strongly supporting this model. For more 
information about TREs, see [our explainer](/explainers/tre).

## Volunteers’ data security
Volunteers have trusted us with their genetic and health data. The health data in particular is extremely sensitive, even when key personally identifying information (e.g. full dates of birth, names, postcodes) have been removed. The number 1 priority for Genes & Health is security of volunteer data.

The Genes & Health Study Protocol states “NHS patient identifiable data will be stored in an ISO27001 and NHS Information Governance toolkit data safe haven (with controlled export) in the UK”

## Ease of dataset maintenance
The ‘bring users to the data’ model (rather than the traditional ‘send users the data’) allows much easier maintenance and updates. Because the multiple, linked, datasets are only in 1 place, we can be sure that everyone has access to all the latest datasets and are not using outdated versions. Some of the genetic datasets are also very large (~Tb) and sending these out as regular updates to multiple users is difficult.
