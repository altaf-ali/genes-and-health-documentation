When first set up, users will get an email from Google (to their normal email address). This will have a [_username@genesandhealth.qmul.ac.uk_](mailto:username@genesandhealth.qmul.ac.uk) username. You need to Add this as a Profile in Google Chrome. Don't try and use any other browser than Google Chrome! This username is not an email address, we won't send email to it.

Once you have done this, go to Manage Your Account / Security and turn 2 Step Verification on. You'll need to enter a phone number and get a code by SMS/text message. You can't get into the TRE without this on. ![](RackMultipart20230315-1-192w74_html_6c37f5e2aa9a04f2.png)

Usually you can then get straight into the TRE from the same device without entering any of username/password/2 Step. Google trusts you! If you use a new device you will need to go through username/password/2 Step authentication again.
