When volunteers take part in stage 1 of Genes & Health their questionnaire and consent form is labelled with the ID number on the Oragene saliva tube (style: 15001502031604). These **Oragene IDs** are then used to label genetic samples (e.g. GSA chip or exome seq). They also label the Questionnaire. Some people have taken part twice (or more than twice) over the years in Genes & Health, and will have a different Oragene ID each time.

Genes & Health uses the Questionnaire data to look up a volunteer's 5236\_cram\_IDlinkage.xlsx(if not already provided). The NHS number (style: 1234567890 ) is one-way pseudonymised (always in the same way using the same encryption key) and the **pseudoNHS number** (style: 0EDFCE604D373660DDF34CA5CBDB754E3BAA17835530591C0161E459A82C7821) is the identified for all types of health record data. A volunteer should only have one single NHS number in NHS systems (we have found a few exceptions to this rule that we have reported to NHS Digital for consideration of merging).

A file is provided linking Oragene ID to pseudoNHS number (see below). Note that this linkage sometimes changes slightly e.g. if we find a missing NHS number, for new samples, or if we identify an error in previous NHS number lookup.

Recall studies (stage 2) get their own stage 2 ID. We will provide files linking to **pseudoNHS number.** The primary identifier used for volunteer recall is the NHS number.

Wellcome Sanger Institute have used several other ID types e.g. sanger sample ID, cram file ID, EBI-EGA submission ID. See below. Broad Institute uses the Oragene ID with a prefix (style: GNH-15001502031604).
